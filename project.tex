\section{Introduction}

\indent This application will be designed to interface, capture and analyze EMG signals from a portable EMG device. 
EMG signals are biomedical signals that measure the muscle fiber potential (muscle action). 
These signals can be used for diagnosing muscle response for both medical and fitness purposes.

\section{Description}

\subsection{System outline}

The application will be composed of a graphical user interface that contains a suite of controls to manage and 
display the capturing of the data from the EMG device. The application will display data as it's being captured as well as provide the user with the option to save and recall the data for offline analysis.

\subsection{Users}

The end-users of the application will include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Private customer
	\item Trainer
	\item Nurse
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Owners}

The owners and maintainers of the application will include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Private customer
	\item Trainer 
	\item Nurse
\end{itemize}

The maintenance including bug fixes will be completed via software updates. The end-user will be responsible
for downloading updated application installation from the web.

\section{Constraints}

The application must be available on both Windows and Mac operating systems, and must interface existing EMG devices. Updates for the application must be made freely available online.  

\section{System features}

\subsection{Data capture}

The application shall be able to capture the EMG signal from the device and save it onto the host of application.

\subsection{Data capture length}

The application shall be able to continuously capture up to 1 hour of data.

\subsubsection{Live data capture}

The application shall capture the live EMG signal form the connected device and display on the graph.

\subsubsection{Noise filtering}

The application shall be able to filter DC to low frequency noise ($<$ 100Hz) and high frequency noise ($>$ 5000Hz). 

\subsubsection{Data filtering}

The following filters shall be made available to be applied on the captured data:

\begin{itemize}
\item average
\item peak
\item RMS
\item low-pass filter
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Graphing of data}

The user shall be able to select the following settings of the graph:

\begin{itemize}
\item Horizontal scale (time measured in seconds)
\item Vertical scale (amplitude measured in millivolts)
\item Grid scale 
\item Adding and removing of x and y markers
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data navigation}

The user shall be able to navigate the captured data along the time axis from start to finish of the captured session.

\subsubsection{Graph saving}

The user shall be able to save the current graph in view to a (.png) image format on the application host.

\subsubsection{Data saving}

The user shall be able to save the raw captured data in (.csv) format along with information about the application version and EMG device (hardware/firmware version and serial number).

\subsubsection{Data recall}

The user shall be able to recall up to two saved captured data in (.csv) format simultaneously and display it on the graph.

\section{Interface}

\subsection{Connecting to an EMG device}

The application shall allow the user to connect to an existing single channel EMG device.

\subsubsection{Connection type}

The application shall allow the user to connect to an EMG device via:

\begin{itemize}
\item Wired connection
\item Wireless
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Retrieving device information}

The application shall allow the user to retrieve EMG device information such as: 

\begin{itemize}
\item device local time
\item battery status
\item firmware version
\item hardware version
\item serial number
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Firmware upgrade}

The application shall be able to perform firmware updates on user discretion if the firmware is out of date.

\subsubsection{Date synchronization}

The application shall automatically synchronize the EMG device local time with the local time of the application.

\section{Quality attributes}

\subsection{User Interface}

The application shall have an intuitive interface with support for a touch screen interface.

\subsubsection{Touch intuitive controls}

The controls of the interface shall be sufficiently large such that an user could access it via a touch screen.

\subsubsection{Device connection}

The user shall be able to connect to the EMG device within 1 minute of opening the application.

\subsubsection{Data Graphing}

The user shall be able to change the colors from a selected list of the following graph elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item Background color of the graph
\item Color of the grid
\item Color of the trace (data)
\item Color of the markers
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data display}

The application shall display the captured date from the EMG device with a delay $\leq$ 0.5s

\subsubsection{Data Recall}

The application shall be able to recall saved data (up to 1 hour long) in no less than 1 minute.

\subsubsection{Menu bar}

The application must feature a menu bar from which common menu items will be available such as: help, settings, file open/close etc.

\subsubsection{Status bar}

The application must feature a status bar where information regarding the EMG device such as: connection status and serial number will be displayed.

\subsubsection{Closing the application}

The user shall be alerted if attempting to close the application during a capturing session.

\subsubsection{Out of range data}

The user shall be notified if the captured data falls out of range of the current graph setting.

\subsection{Standards Compliance}

The application must be compliant with IEC 62304:2006 standard.

\section{Background Research}

My background research is mostly due to my industry experience in the field. However, I heavily referenced \cite{Biometrics} and \cite{Laborie}
to draw some ideas for the most critical features that an EMG capturing application would have. Obviously, graphing is the most important feature
which both of the applications provided by Biometrics and Laborie do. Along with that they offer the ability to custumize the graph in terms scale,
colors and ability to add markers for measurements. Additionally, both offered the ability to save the capture data and recall for later analysis 
with optional features of saving a quick image capture of the graph. Another optional feature that each offer is the ability to filter the data using
standard array of filters. I decided to include the basic array of filtering for now, but other types can always be added in later revisions of the application. 

\section{Scenarios}

\subsection{Adding a new EMG device}

\subsubsection{Positive Normal}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item User connects to a new EMG device
	\item Application retrieves EMG device information
	\item EMG device confirmed acceptable
	\item Date is synchronized with the device
	\item Device is ready to be used to capture data
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Postive Abnormal}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item User connects to a new EMG device
	\item Application retrieves EMG device information
	\item EMG device confirmed unacceptable
	\item Error message is displayed that the device is not compatible 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Graphing data}

\subsubsection{Positive Normal}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item User starts capturing data from EMG device
	\item Application starts displaying data on the graph
	\item User adjusts the graph vertical and horizontal scales
	\item User adds markers to the graph
	\item Data is captured up to 1 hour in length
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Negative}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item User tries to change the graph colors while capturing
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Saving and recalling data}

\subsubsection{Positive Normal}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item After a capture user saves data onto local disk
	\item Application saves data in (.csv) format onto disk
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Negative}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item User tries to open a corrupted data file  
\end{enumerate}
