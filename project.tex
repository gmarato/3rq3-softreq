\section{Introduction}

\indent This application will be designed to interface, capture and analyze electromyography (EMG) signals from a portable EMG device. 
EMG signals are biomedical signals that measure the muscle fiber potential (muscle action). 
These signals can be used for diagnosing muscle response for both medical and fitness purposes \cite{Mayo Clinic}.

\section{Data Requirements}

\subsection{Overview}

\begin{itemize}
	\item EMG device - will track the EMG devices that are connected to the application. User can potentially connect many devices to host however, only one device can be connect to application and capturing.
						This class will only be useful for firmware updates. 
	\item Data capture - will contain and track the EMG data that is being captured by the application
	\item Data recall - is a relationship with the data capture inheriting all of its methods and attributes. 
						Additional attributes such as date of capture and total length of data captured are added as useful information
	\item Graph - will track the main graph along with its possible two channels and different settings of each individual channels. 
						Since there is only one graph, some settings of individual channel like scales and colors are common, however each channel could have individual markers and marker colors as well as trace color
	\item Channel - since we have two channels we need to track the settings to each individual channel
	\item Settings - contains the many settings that can be applied to a channel within the single graph
	\item Filter - contains information about the filter types and orders (how intense the filter is). Multiple filter types can be applied to the data capture (high, low-pass etc.)
	\item Filter types (low, high, average, peak) - is a relationship with the filter class. Each filter type in itself can branch to many subtypes and have different properties such as cut-off frequencies, amplitude, weight
\end{itemize}

\section{Background Research}

My background research is mostly due to my industry experience in the field. However, I heavily referenced \cite{Biometrics} and \cite{Laborie}
to draw some ideas for the most critical features that an EMG capturing application would have. Obviously, graphing is the most important feature
which both of the applications provided by Biometrics and Laborie do. Along with that they offer the ability to customize the graph in terms scale,
colors and ability to add markers for measurements. Additionally, both offered the ability to save the capture data and recall for later analysis 
with optional features of saving a quick image capture of the graph. Another optional feature that each offer is the ability to filter the data using
standard array of filters. I decided to include the basic array of filtering for now, but other types can always be added in later revisions of the application.
